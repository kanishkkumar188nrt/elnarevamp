                    ELNA is a passion which has come up after dreaming and wondering in classrooms as a child
                    student, wondering why can’t we take so-called education beyond classrooms and connect it
                    with the social environment. This inquisitiveness made Surekha pursue Non Profit Leadership
                    (NPL) course at University of Pennsylvania. After coming back , she decided to help today’s
                    young generation understand the importance of application based methodology and how to
                    reach the root cause of a problem, which she herself understood after completing 20 years of
                    formal education and more than six plus years of work in corporate and social sector. In 2012,
                    ELNA was started with the objective of bringing Education Live in the classrooms.
                    Surekha is an MBA from Symbiosis Institute of Management Studies, Pune and MS in Non-profit
                    Leadership from University of Pennsylvania. She has a research paper on WFP published as a
                    monograph in 2011- ‘History of Present’ Human Resource Crisis at World Food Programme.
                    Surekha is passionate about writing in the field of education and loves gardening as her hobby.

                <p>
                    Savitri always wanted to be an IAS officer but ended up being a teacher which she resisted in the

                    beginning only to discover later that teaching was not a profession for me but a passion .And

                    it took her so many years to undo the layers of influence exerted by her surroundings. Often

                    passion is mixed with ambition. Passion is like a perennial fountain whereas ambition is like a

                    rain fed river. She chose to be with her passion not ambition.

                    Savitri has been in teaching profession for more than 30 years with the experience of teaching

                    from class prep to senior secondary classes she brings in with her a rich and varied experience

                    leading to the point when one can actually fathom the true meaning of teaching and its

                    nuances.

                    Learning from children, learning from the varied environment they come from and the

                    challenges emerging out of overcrowded classrooms and over loaded curriculum along with

                    many other well known problems. She truly believes in finding a way out of all these problems

                    via her teaching methods.

                    Savitri found herself getting closer and closer to ELNA because she could see the sprouts of

                    some real learning taking place .ELNA is on its way to do what she has always been thinking of .

                    That’s why Savitri decided to connect herself and move along on the journey with the hope that

                    one day these little sprouts will grow into plants and into a full fledged crop in time to come.

                    Savitri Waldia is MA in English and loves to write on school education in her free time.
